We explore how the welfare outcomes of a coordination game depend on network structure and the distribution of ideal points throughout the network. To this end, we imagine a benevolent or adversarial planner who intervenes, at a cost, to change ideal points in order to maximize or minimize utilitarian welfare subject to a constraint. A complete characterization of optimal interventions is obtained by decomposing interventions into principal components of the network's adjacency matrix. Welfare is most sensitive to interventions proportional to the last principal component, which focus on local disagreement. A welfare-maximizing planner optimally works to reduce local disagreement, bringing the ideal points of neighbors closer together, whereas a malevolent adversary optimally drives neighbors' ideal points apart to decrease welfare. Such welfare-maximizing/minimizing interventions are very different from ones that would be done to change some traditional measures of discord, such as the cross-sectional variation of equilibrium actions. In fact, an adversary sowing disagreement to maximize her impact on welfare will minimize her impact on global variation in equilibrium actions, underscoring a tension between improving welfare and increasing global cohesion of equilibrium behavior.<br></h4><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" role="button" href="assets/discord.pdf">PDF</a>

Parkes</strong></a><br><br><strong>Working Paper (June 2021)</strong><br><br>Uniswap is the largest decentralized exchange for digital currencies. The newest version, called Uniswap v3, allows liquidity providers to allocate liquidity to one or more closed intervals of the price of an asset, instead of over the total range of prices. While the price of the asset remains in that interval, the liquidity provider earns rewards proportionally to the amount of liquidity allocated. This induces the problem of strategic liquidity provision: smaller intervals result in higher concentration of liquidity and correspondingly larger rewards when the price remains in the interval, but with higher risk. We formalize this problem and study three classes of strategies for liquidity providers: uniform, proportional, and optimal (via a constrained optimization problem). We present experimental results based on the historical price data of Ethereum, which show that simple liquidity provision strategies can yield near-optimal utility and earn over 200x more than Uniswap v2 liquidity provision.<br></h4><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" role="button" href="assets/uniswap.pdf">PDF</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" role="button" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12033">arXiv</a>

In a malicious reorg, an attacker withholds their blocks and attestations before releasing them at an opportune time in order to force a chain reorganization, which they can take advantage of by double-spending or front-running transactions. A finality delay aims to increase the mean and variance of the time it takes blocks to become finalized and thus impacts the efficiency and predictability of the system.

We study the rate at which an attacker can execute reorgs in the Tezos Proof-of-Stake protocol. As an example, an attacker with 40% of the staking power is able to execute a 20-block malicious reorg at an average rate of once per day, and the attack probability increases super-linearly as the staking power grows beyond 40%. Moreover, an attacker of the Tezos protocol knows in advance when an attack opportunity will arise, and can use this knowledge to arrange transactions to double-spend. We show that in particular cases, the Tezos protocol can be adjusted to protect against deep reorgs. For instance, we demonstrate protocol parameters that reduce the rate of length-20 reorg opportunities for a 40% attacker by two orders of magnitude. We also observe a trade-off between optimizing for robustness to deep reorgs (costly deviations that may be net profitable because they enable double-spends) and robustness to selfish mining (mining deviations that result in typically short reorgs that are profitable even without double-spends). That is, the parameters that optimally protect against one make the other attack easy. Finally, we develop a method that monitors the Tezos blockchain health with respect to malicious reorgs using only publicly available information.<br></h4><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" role="button" href="assets/tezos-reorgs-aft20.pdf">PDF</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" role="button" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3419614.3423265">Proceedings</a><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" role="button" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05413">arXiv</a>

In doing so, we provide a theoretical analysis of the feasibility and profitability of a block stealing attack that we call selfish endorsing, a concrete instance of an attack previously only theoretically considered. We propose and analyze a simple change to the Tezos protocol which significantly reduces the (already small) profitability of this dishonest behavior, and introduce a new delay and reward scheme that is provably secure against length-1 and length-2 selfish endorsing attacks.
